## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you're interested in contributing to XJTU-ICS, please follow these steps üëÄ:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.

It's always a good habit to check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/xjtu-ics/textbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing ‚ö†Ô∏è!

If you are curious about how to set up a textbook with mdBook, we have also provided a [detailed tutorial](https://blog.bxhu2004.com/BLOG/Markdown/mdbook-site/) for you to start.
