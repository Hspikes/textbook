# Introduction to Computer Systems

> By [ICS Contributors](./contributors.md), based on lectures by [Danfeng Shan](https://dfshan.github.io/), [Hao Li](https://aquatoney.github.io/), and others.

These are the course notes for [COMPSCI 400727: Introduction to Computer Systems](https://xjtu-ics.github.io/) at Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Here is the official course description:

```admonish info
This course is inspired by the [CMU-15-213 curriculum](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/) and delves into the intricacies of computer hardware, guiding students through the step-by-step process of how C code is translated into X86_64 assembly and executed on the CPU. The course is structured with increasing levels of complexity:

It begins with __data representation__, introducing the fundamental concepts of __assembly language__, followed by an exploration of memory structure and the significance of __cache design__. The course then covers __CPU pipelining__ and strategies for program optimization to enhance performance. Additionally, we will examine how a C program transitions into machine-readable machine code, including the process of __linking__. Finally, the concept of __virtual memory__ will be introduced.

As an introductory course to systems, it offers both depth and breadth, serving as a prerequisite for future research in computer architecture and network systems.
